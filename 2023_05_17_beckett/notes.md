Installed new BlueOS, new firmware (4.1.1 beta 5).

Calibrated everything again at Beckett. Compass calibration was green for both compasses! Picked the best compass as pri1.

Adjusted ballast, still not perfect. Need a bit more weight on the starboard side, and a bit less weight stern.

Run out at Beckett, looking at stabilize and depth hold.
Stabilize looks pretty good.
Depth hold showed jerks in roll, even when it was just sitting there in calm water.
